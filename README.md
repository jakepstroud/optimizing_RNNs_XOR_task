# optimizing_RNNs_XOR_task
Python code for optimizing and analysing recurrent neural networks trained on an XOR task. See Stroud et al., Effects of noise and metabolic cost on
cortical task representations, Elife, 2025.

'RNN_XOR_class.py' is the class for all the functions needed to train, plot, and analyse networks.
'create_and_train_networks.py' is the script for training, plotting, and analysing networks and utilises the 'RNN_XOR_class.py' file.
